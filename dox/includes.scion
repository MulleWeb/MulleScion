Includes predicatably reads in another file. It's like copy/paste but 
MulleScionTemplates does the work for you. The contents are parsed just like
any regular template text.

There is a special includes called includes verbatim. It reads the contents of
a file but doesn't parse it.

Here we include _spaces.scion and have the comments parsed away

{% includes "_spaces.scion" %}

and the file included verbatim

{% includes verbatim "_spaces.scion" %}
