MulleScionTemplates is a modern template engine for Objective C
                                             (written in an oldfashioned way :)

It's heavily (very heavily) inspired by 

TWIG "The flexible, fast, and secure template engine for PHP"
"http://twig.sensiolabs.org/"


MulleScionTemplates is fairly flexible, reasonably fast and can be made as
 secure as you wish. 

    Reasonably 
    Fast:      MulleScion can compile templates into a compressed archive 
               format. Loading such an archive is lots faster than parsing. A 
               compiled template is read-only, you can use it many times to 
               render different output from different input.

    Secure:    MulleScion has hooks so your application can ensure that 
               untrusted template code doesn't have access to all of the input 
               data.

    Flexible:  There is the possibility of extending KVC and writing your own
               "builtin" fuctions. A template can (if allowed) execute arbitrary
               ObjC code.


Using the MulleScionTemplates.framework. Creating a string from your object 
using a template file is as easy as:

 NSString  *output;
 
 output = [MulleScionTemplate descriptionWithTemplateFile:@"test.scion"
                                               dataSource:self];


MulleScionTemplates is a work in progress, but it looks good to me.



DOCUMENTATION
=============
Non existing. MulleScion is very similar to TWIG, you can glean much
of relevance from http://twig.sensiolabs.org. Also check out the supplied test
templates and the source, which do have some comments. If you see a feature in
TWIG but don't see it in the test file, it's not there.


LIMITATIONS
=============
Because you can execute arbitrary ObjC methods, and have access to Key Value
Coding, MulleScion can pretty much do anything. MulleScionTemplates uses 
NSInvocation for method calls, and it usually can not do variable arguments. 
So that will be a problem. Be wary of anything using structs and C-Arrays and 
C-strings, although MulleScionTemplates tries to be as helpful as possible.

MulleScionTemplates doesn't prevent you from trying stupid things.


TODO
=============
Will probably do filters some time.
Would be nice to have delayed evaluation for render results.
