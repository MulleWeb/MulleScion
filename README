Project Goals
=============

1. Compatible with 10.4 (why ? because I want to run it with MulleFoundation)
2. Keep Parser and Printer independent (why ? To allow apps to only use a few
pre-rendered templates)
3. Offload complexity into the Parser. The Printer should be fast and lean.
4. Try to conserve memory.
5. Be reasonably close to TWIG (PHP Templates), but don't break a leg.
6. mulle-scion executable is currently 110K (much too big!)
