v1848.3  !!massive changes!!

your compiled scionz files are incompatible now. Throw them away
and rebuild your caches

you used to be able to have random trash after valid scion code, which was nice
for documentation. That doesn't work anymore in most cases

you can now write multiline scripts, but some keywords need still to be 
enclosed as singles in {% %} like macro, block, endblock, extends and maybe
some others

there are the beginnings of a test suite, check out the tests folder. there is
a simple shellscript that runs the tests

lots of smaller fixes, whose content one might glean from the git comments
