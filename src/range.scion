For those special moments, when you really want to use range. There is only
one function built in, and that's

NSMakeRange

but you can extend this easily.


{{ [@"VfL Bochum 1848" substringWithRange:NSMakeRange( 4, 6)] }}
{# stupid pet tricks, achived by a category on NSValue #}
{{ [@"VfL Bochum 1848" rangeOfString:@"18"].location }}
